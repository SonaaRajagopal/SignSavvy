## 🚀 Overview

**SignSavvy** is a powerful, end-to-end **traffic sign detection and recognition system** built on a custom-trained **YOLOv9 model**. Designed to operate with high accuracy and speed, it combines real-time object detection with a responsive web interface and robust backend architecture. With a detection accuracy of **93%**, SignSavvy is well-suited for both research and deployment in real-world intelligent traffic systems.



## 🌟 Features

### 🔍 High-Accuracy Detection
- Custom-trained **YOLOv9** model on a diverse dataset of traffic signs  
- Achieves **93% detection accuracy**, even under low light, occlusion, or motion blur  

### 💻 User-Friendly Web Interface
- Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Users can upload images via a responsive UI
- Detected signs are displayed with bounding boxes in real-time  

### ⚡ Efficient Backend Integration
- Developed using **PHP**, the backend handles:
  - User authentication
  - Image transfer and processing
  - Communication with the detection engine  

### 🗂️ Optimized Database Management
- Uses a well-indexed **MySQL** database  
- Schema design optimized to **reduce query latency by 40%**

### 📈 Scalable & Extensible
- Modular architecture supports:
  - Adding new traffic signs
  - Extending to broader object detection tasks (e.g., pedestrians, signals)

### 🔒 Secure Data Handling
- Implements best practices in **user data privacy** and **secure file handling**

## 📦 How It Works

1. **User uploads an image** via the web interface
2. The image is sent to the backend (PHP)
3. YOLOv9 model runs detection and returns bounding box data
4. Detected signs are highlighted and results shown in the browser
5. Data is optionally logged in the MySQL database



## 🧠 Potential Use Cases

- Smart traffic monitoring
- Driver assistance systems
- Autonomous vehicle training
- Road safety analysis
- Intelligent transport infrastructure
